	<h1> This is <i>still</i> a motherfucking website.</h1>
		<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

	<h2> Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this <br/> shit.</h2>


	<h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3>

		<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a>  into this easy-to-read <br/> masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass <br/> website:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Shit's <i>still</i> lightweight and loads fast</li>
			<li> <i>Still</i> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
			<li><i>Still</i> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
			<li>The motherfucker's <i>still</i> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
			<li>Shit's <i>still</i> elegible and gets your fucking point across</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>	

		<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>

	<h2>Let it breathe</h2>

		<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not <br/> married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <br/> <span class="lineheight"> line-height: 1.4 </span> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see <br/> that...piss off. <br/> <p/>

		If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? <br/> Yes? What a shitty book.

	<h2>A little less contrast</h2>

		<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a <br/> bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so <br/> focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

	<h2>Size Matters</h2>

		<p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to <br/> 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

	<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

		<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's <br/> 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more <br/> than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

	<h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

		<p>I love what the creator of this site's inspiration did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so <br/> simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, <br/> high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web <br/> designers out there need to make them not total shit. <br/> <span class="moron">"You're a fucking moron if you use default browser styles." </span> <br/> <span class="Eleanor"> - Eleanor Roosevelt </span>  </p>
